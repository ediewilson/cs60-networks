## How do I compile and run our STUN NAT-detector?
This is still a work in progress, I got really behind on a bunch of work. Sorry about that and I'm going to try to get it done as soon as possible. 

## What type of NAT do you believe you are behind?
According to Stack Overflow, if STUN test tells you that you're behind a Symmetric NAT than that is the case, but if it tells you otherwise, you can't be 100% sure. My STUN has yet to tell me anything because it's not working quite yet. 

## Were you able to receive a UDP packet from a fellow student? (From which student(s) did you try?)
I haven't tried yet.

## What is your timezone and do you have preferences for final-project group members? (I'll use this info to make final project groups: first I group according to preference, then to timezone, then to programming language)
I don't have a preference for final groupmates, I'm in Central Time, -1 from Eastern time. Java is my ideal language, but C and python are both okay too!
